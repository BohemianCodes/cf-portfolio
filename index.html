        <p>I come from a background of travelling and living a free spirited life. The jump to become a digital nomad is not as far as some people think. I love the outdoors, but I also love coding.</p>

          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>I would enjoy a portfolio that is simple and reflects my personality. I would like it to be with a nice touch of colors and patterns as well as atmospheric pictures. I like to combine coding with a free-spirited life and this should be visible on my portfolio. I don't have many projects to showcase yet, but I am interested in e.g. creating websites for NGOs and good causes as my personal practise. </p>

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>I am happy to be able to commit to a full-time course of 40 hours a week. I am especially looking forward to learn Ruby on Rails. I am also very interested in having more in-depth knowledge of responsive websites and I am highly motivated to become a professional developer. </p>

          <h2>Course Goals</h2>
          <p>My ideal work is freelancer work. I wouldn't mind starting with a job in a company in order to get more experience, but my ultimate goal is being able to work independently and project-based. </p>
